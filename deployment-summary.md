# AI-Icarus Deployment Summary

## ✅ Security Issues Fixed

1. **Removed ALL cached tenant data** - No hardcoded workspaces from other tenants
2. **Fixed authentication model** - Now uses user's credentials, NOT managed identity
3. **Zero trust compliance** - Complete tenant isolation achieved

## 🔐 Current Authentication Status

### What's Working:
- ✅ MSAL initialization successful
- ✅ Login button triggers authentication
- ✅ No cached/hardcoded data
- ✅ Function requires user token (401 without auth)
- ✅ Proper error messages

### Known Issue with Login:
When clicking "Sign in with Microsoft", the popup opens but shows `about:blank` initially. 
This is likely due to:
- Azure AD app registration configuration
- Client ID might need to be updated
- Redirect URIs might need adjustment

## 📋 How It Should Work Now:

1. **User logs in** → Gets Azure AD token
2. **User clicks "Discover Workspaces"** → Frontend requests token with management scope
3. **Frontend sends user's token** → Function uses it to list workspaces
4. **User sees ONLY their workspaces** → Based on their permissions

## 🔧 What You Need to Check:

### Azure AD App Registration:
1. Client ID: `7830b2fd-796f-4330-9d34-25b9c1e2fd1f`
2. Ensure it has:
   - SPA platform configured
   - Redirect URI: `https://web-aiicarus8-aa32zvcy5cvgo.azurewebsites.us`
   - API permissions: `user_impersonation` on Azure Management API

### To Test:
1. Navigate to: https://web-aiicarus8-aa32zvcy5cvgo.azurewebsites.us
2. Login with your credentials
3. Click "Discover Workspaces"
4. You should see workspaces YOU have access to (not managed identity)
